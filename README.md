# Semi-Automatic-Coconut-Tree-Climber-and-Harvester
Now a days the major challenge for the farming community is labor shortage hence the main aim of our project is to design a semi-automatic coconut Harvester to harvest the coconut, this will resolve two major issues such as accident and shortage of labor.  In order to solve this major issue, a semi-automate coconut harvester is proposed to harvest coconut(s) without the assistance of skilled labor with high efficiency.  The idea of this project is to design and develop a semi-automated coconut tree climber and harvester which is efficient, economical and user friendly. The equipment consists of  three motors that are used to drive the body. The body is made of hexagon shape. It consists of robotic arm for cutting down the nuts and power supply is provided by a battery pack from the ground. The device is controlled and operated through wireless connection by human in mobile application.
